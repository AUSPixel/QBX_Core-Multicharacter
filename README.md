# QBX_Core-Multicharacter
This is just a small addition to the default qbx_core resource, adding a UI for the character selection.

To install, simply replace your qbx_core/client/character.lua with the one provided and the same for fxmanifest.lua.
Once done you need to import the HTML folder into your qbx_core main folder.
That's it. All done, restart your server and test it out!

For personalisation to suit your server, you will need to populate the folder html/logo/... with your job icons.
I haven't included many options for this.
